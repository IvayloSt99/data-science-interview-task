<h1>Read before trying to run!</h1>

I manage python environments on my computer using Conda. Therefore, for some reason I couldn't package the project using Poetry as I originally intended to, but people trying to run the project could still install all the dependencies to a virtual environent using pip and requirements.txt OR running env.sh. Then simply run main.py. I have no experience using Docker at all, so I cannot verify whether it works at all, but all the scripts can still be run locally just fine. Same regarding the FastAPI deployment.
